# PORTED TO TAILWIND [xtendui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xtendui)

## Installation

```Shell
npm install xtend-library --save
```

## Usage

We have some boilerplate setup projects to start a project:

* [vanilla boilerplate](https://github.com/minimit/xtend-theme-vanilla)

#### Webpack

This library is made to be used by [webpack](https://github.com/webpack). In essence you have to setup webpack's resolve to be able to import the scripts and styles from the `node_modules/xtend-library` or from your custom folder if present (`./dist/xtend-library` in this case).

```jsx
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // resolve xtend-library js and less
      'xtend-library': [
        path.resolve(__dirname, './dist/xtend-library'),
        path.resolve(__dirname, './node_modules/xtend-library'),
      ],
    },
  },
  module: {
    unsafeCache: false,
```

With this setup you can **fork** css and js files inside `./dist/xtend-library` and the webpack resolver will load files from it or fallback to `./node_modules/xtend-library`.

**IMPORTANT** do not fork the files inside `./core/demos` they can change anytime

#### Css

You need to import the **reset** file as first import:

```less
@import 'xtend-library/src/xtend-reset.less'; // always first loaded
```

Then you can import the **components you need** as described in the docs:

```less
@import (reference) '/src/xtend-core.less'; // be sure to import the library as reference first
@import 'xtend-library/src/extensions/slider/slider.less';
```

Or just import **all core** and **extensions** and **addons** needed (preferred method):

```less
@import 'xtend-library/src/xtend-core.less';
@import 'xtend-library/src/extensions/slider/slider.less';
```

To modify a **less** or **js** file add [webpack resolve](/introduction/setup#usage-webpack) and fork the file copying it in your project.

#### Js

You need to install [relaxed-json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relaxed-json):

```Shell
npm install --save relaxed-json
```

You need to install and import [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js):

```Shell
npm install --save core-js@2
```

```jsx
import 'core-js'
```

You need to import the **polyfills** files and the **main** js:

```jsx
import '/src/polyfill.js'
import { Xt } from '/src/xt.js'
```

Then you can import the **components you need** as described in the docs:

```jsx
import '/src/extensions/slider/slider.js'
```

Or just import **all core** and **extensions** and **addons** needed (preferred method):

```jsx
import '/src/xtend-core.js'
import '/src/extensions/slider/slider.js'
```

To modify a **less** or **js** file add [webpack resolve](/introduction/setup#usage-webpack) and fork the file copying it in your project.

#### Gsap

This library in the demos uses [gsap](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP) and [bezier-easing](https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing) for javascript animations.

```
npm install --save gsap bezier-easing
```

## Browser support
